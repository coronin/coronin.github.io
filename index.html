## ABOUT
Cell Design Labs is a biotherapeutics company pioneering breakthrough science to develop disruptive therapies for cancer and other devastating diseases.  Cell Design Labs leverages the power of the body’s immune system to develop smart, living therapies with the capability to treat our most challenging diseases with unprecedented power, precision, safety and durability.  
Scientists have long recognized that the body’s immune system can be a powerful ally in the fight against cancer and other diseases. But until recently, harnessing the immune system has been difficult.  Cancer cells can adeptly evade immune detection, and directly stimulating the immune system to overcome this subterfuge, while occasionally successful, is often dangerous because of the immune system's powerful and undiscriminating actions.  However, as researchers continue expanding our understanding of immune cell interactions, we are on the edge of a new era of medicine in which we can precisely instruct and guide immune cells to recognize and eliminate disease, even when that disease is working hard to defeat the immune system.
At Cell Design Labs we are discovering and building the next generation of anti-cancer therapies. We do this by modifying the body’s immune cells to create therapeutic agents capable of selectively recognizing, disabling and destroying malignant threats. At the heart of Cell Design Labs technology is a proprietary collection of distinct modules.  This Cell Design Labs toolkit of proprietary molecular modules can be deployed in an immune cell to systematically program the cell’s specificity and carefully target its lethal killing force.  At its core, we are directing a living cell to identify a specific threat and neutralize it without harming adjacent tissues. By harnessing this natural power we are able to create smart, living therapies.  Our therapies, which are able to recognize and respond to disease signatures, may also have applications in autoimmune and degenerative disorders,  and other challenging diseases that we face today.

#### TEAM
We have assembled a team of scientists, innovators and advisors recognized for their pioneering work in discovering, developing and delivering new treatments to patients. We approach each day looking for powerful ways to unravel the mysteries of the human body in order to create precision therapies for the most challenging diseases.

## SCIENCE
The science of Cell Design Labs begins with the core idea of re-engineering the molecular machinery of a human cell so that it will perform a new therapeutic function. While such concepts have long been imagined, only in the last five years has our knowledge and technology converged to allow cells to be engineered with the precision and control required for therapeutic applications. Research from Dr. Wendell Lim’s lab at the University of California, San Francisco, has led to the development and licensing of a collection of foundational molecular control modules. The variety of these molecular modules has led to the creation of a comprehensive toolbox that the company uses to genetically engineer human cells with therapeutic programs that are customized to precisely sense and disable the targeted disease.
Cell Design Labs is first deploying its disruptive technology in re-engineering human immune cells to fight cancer. The most important of these immune cells are T cells, which have been shown to be powerful agents to treat cancers of the blood when engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs).  Cell Design Labs’ proprietary ON-OFF switches and synthetic Notch receptors now provide T cells with a far greater capability to recognize cancer and other disease tissues in a precise and controlled manner. This new toolkit for cellular engineering opens up the possibility to expand the use of cell therapies to solid tumors, providing treatments with unprecedented power, precision, safety and durability. 

#### Current initiatives:
Precise sensing of disease tissue based on combinatorial signals – we are directing engineered T cells to migrate to and precisely recognize disease cells and tumor microenvironments, while not reacting to related normal cells.
Overcoming and disabling the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the tumor – we are developing response programs that drive more potent T cell proliferation and activity in solid tumors. 
Enhancing safety mechanisms – we are developing fast-acting control switches that can prevent the often sudden, and life threatening, side effects traditionally associated with immunotherapy. 
These disruptive capabilities in cellular engineering can be applied to many complex diseases where there are now major treatment gaps, including autoimmune and degenerative disorders. At Cell Design Labs we are building a broad technology platform to become the pre-eminent cell engineering company.
